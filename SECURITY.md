## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in the Sniffa project, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly**. We ask that you **contact us privately** to ensure the issue can be fixed before others are impacted.
2. **Send your report to [contact@0xsarwagya.codes](mailto:contact@0xsarwagya.codes)**. Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, the potential impact, and steps to reproduce it, if possible.
3. **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge your report within 48 hours. We will prioritize high-severity issues and work on fixing them as soon as possible.
4. **Resolution Process**: After we evaluate the vulnerability:
   - If it is valid and accepted, we will work on a fix and release a patch.
   - We will then notify you, along with a public disclosure on the GitHub Security Advisories page.
5. **Disclosure**: We aim to patch security vulnerabilities in a timely manner and will release updates as necessary. We may, in some cases, disclose information about the vulnerability publicly once it has been resolved.

**Please note**: We highly encourage responsible disclosure to ensure that vulnerabilities are properly addressed before they can be exploited.

Thank you for helping make Sniffa more secure!
